# CALORIE COUNTER

## SAMPLE OVERVIEW
Sometimes when coding a web application, there will be need to be able to accept input from a user. In this calorie counter project, I am enforcing through practice and learning how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update the interface to display the results.

In this practice project, I am learning basic regular expressions, template literals, the addEventListener() method, and more.
